<div class="quote"><br><br>"I will regard the heavens, the air, the earth, colors, shapes, sounds, and all external things as nothing but the deceptive games of my dreams..."

<div class="quote"><br><br>"But could youth last and love still breed,<br>Had joys no date nor age nor need,<br>Then these delights my mind might move<br>To live with thee and be thy love."
<br>Sir Walter Raleigh<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"If the stakes ever became high enough―if the evil were evil enough―I would simply tap into a secret reservoir of courage that had been accumulating inside me over the years. Courage, I seemed to think, comes to us in finite quantities, like an inheritance, and by being frugal and stashing it away and letting it earn interest, we steadily increase our moral capital in preparation for that day when the account must be drawn down. It was a comforting theory. It dispensed with all those bothersome little acts of daily courage; it offered hope and grace to the repetitive coward; it justified the past while amortizing the future."
<br>Tim O'Brien<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"[N]ow I remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse to seek real knowledge of life amid its perils... I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped."
<br>Charlotte Brontë<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"The flaw, or crack in character, is really nothing―and need be nothing―but his inherent unwillingness to remain passive in the face of what he conceives to be a challenge to his dignity, his image of his rightful status. Only the passive, only those who accept their lot without active retaliation, are 'flawless.' Most of us are in this category."
<br>Arthur Miller<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"Therefore, the wise thing is for us diligently to train ourselves to lie thoughtfully, judiciously; to lie with good object, and not an evil one; to lie for others' advantage, and not our own; to lie healingly, charitably, humanely, and not cruelly, hurtfully, maliciously; to lie gracefully and graciously, not awkwardly and clumsily; to lie firmly, frankly, squarely, with head erect, not haltingly, tortuously, with pusillanimous mien, as being ashamed of our high calling."
<br>Mark Twain<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"'Willy, when're you gonna realize that them things don't mean anything? You named him Howard, but you can't sell that. The only thing you got in this world is what you can sell. And the funny thing is that you're a salesman, and you don't know that.'"

<div class="quote"><br><br>"Then with a pleasure which is both sensual and intellectual we shall watch the artist build his castle of cards and watch the castle of cards become a castle of beautiful steel and glass."

<div class="quote"><br><br>"Her shoes were comfortable. They reflected her hope for the evening."
<br>William Peter Blatty<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"I speak of love that comes to mind:<br>
The moon is faithful, although blind;<br>
She moves in thought she cannot speak.<br>
Perfect care has made her bleak.<br>
I never dreamed the sea so deep,<br>
The earth so dark; so long my sleep,<br>
I have become another child.<br>
I wake to see the world go wild."
<br>Allen Ginsberg<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"Bermingham didn't press him on the reasons for his doubt. For which Karras was grateful. He knew that his answers would have sounded insane: *The need to rend food with the teeth and then defecate. My mother's nine First Fridays. Stinking socks. Thalidomide babies. An item in the paper about a young altar boy waiting at a bus stop; set on by strangers; sprayed with kerosene; ignited.* No. No, too emotional. Vague. Existential. More rooted in logic was the silence of God. In the world there was evil and much of it resulted from doubt, from an honest confusion among men of good will. Would a reasonable God refuse to end it? Not finally reveal Himself? Not speak?
<br>"Lord, give us a sign..."
<br>The raising of Lazarus was dim in the distant past.No one now living had heard his laughter.
<br>*And so why not a sign?*
<br>At various times Karras longed to have lived with Christ; to have seen him; to have touched him; to have probed his eyes.
<br>*Ah, my God, let me see you! Let me know! Come in dreams!*
<br>The yearning consumed him."
<br>William Peter Blatty<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"We call contrary to nature what happens contrary to custom; nothing is anything but according to nature, whatever it may be. Let this universal and natural reason drive out of us the error and astonishment that novelty brings us."
<br>Michel de Montaigne<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"We have familiar experience of the order, the constancy, the perpetual renovation of the material world which surrounds us. Frail and transitory as is every part of it, restless and migratory as are its elements, still it abides. It is bound together by a law of permanence, and though it is ever dying, it is ever coming to life again. Dissolution does but give birth to fresh modes of organization, and one death is the parent of a thousand lives. Each hour, as it comes, is but a testimony how fleeting, yet how secure, how certain, is the great whole. It is like an image on the waters, which is ever the same, though the waters ever flow. The sun sinks to rise again; the day is swallowed up in the gloom of night, to be born out of it, as fresh as if it had never been quenched. Spring passes into summer, and through summer and autumn into winter, only the more surely, by its own ultimate return, to triumph over that grave towards which it resolutely hastened from its first hour. We mourn the blossoms of May because they are to wither; but we know that May is one day to have its revenge upon November, by the revolution of that solemn circle which never stops―which teaches us in our height of hope, ever to be sober, and in our depth of desolation, never to despair."
<br>John Henry Newman<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"'Ah, well...at last I realized that God would never ask of me that which I know to be psychologically impossible; that the love which He asked was in my WILL and not meant to be felt as emotion. No. Not at all. He was asking that I ACT with love; that I DO unto others; and that I should do it unto those who repelled me, I believe, was a greater act of love than any other... How many husbands and wives...must believe they have fallen out of love because their hearts no longer race at the sight of their beloveds... There it lies...possession; not in wars, as some tend to believe; not so much; and very rarely in extraordinary interventions such as here...this girl...this poor child. No, I tend to see possession most often in the little things, Damien: in the senseless, petty spites and misunderstandings; the cruel and cutting word that leaps unbidden to the tongue between friends. Between lovers. Between husbands and wives. Enough of these and we have no need of Satan to manage our wars; these we manage for ourselves...for ourselves... And yet even from this―from evil―there will finally come good in some way; in some way that we may never understand or even see... Perhaps evil is the crucible of goodness... And perhaps even Satan―Satan, in spite of himself―somehow serves to work out the will of God.'"
<br>William Peter Blatty<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow Roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars."
<br>Jack Kerouac<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"'...an 'extraordinary' man has the right...that is not an official right, but an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep...certain obstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfillment of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity). You say that my article isn't definite; I am ready to make it as clear as I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well. I maintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a hundred, or more people, Newton would have had the right, would in fact have been duty bound...to eliminate a dozen or a hundred men for the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity. But it does not follow from that that Newton had the right to murder people right and left and to steal every day in the market. Then, I remember, I maintain in my article that all...well, legislators and leaders, such as Lycurgus, Solon, Muhammed, Napoleon, and so on, were all without exception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they transgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held sacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either, if that bloodshed―often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defense of ancient law―were of use to their cause. It's remarkable, in fact, that the majority, in fact, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity were guilty of terrible carnage. In short, I maintain that all great people or even people who are slightly uncommon, that is to say capable of producing some new idea, must by nature be criminals―more or less, of course. Otherwise it's hard for them to get out of the common rut; and to remain in the common rut is what they can't submit to, from their very nature again, and to my mind they ought not, in fact, to submit to it. You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that. The same thing has been printed and read a thousand times before. As for my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge that it's somewhat arbitrary, but I don't insist upon exact numbers. I only believe in my leading idea that men are in general divided by a law of nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say, material that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have the gift or the talent to produce something new. There are, of course, innumerable sub-divisions, but the distinguishing features of both categories are fairly well-marked. The first category, generally speaking, contains men who are conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live under control and love to be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty to be controlled, because that's their vocation, and there is nothing humiliating in it for them. The second category transgresses the law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their capacities. The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied; for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the present for the sake of the better. But if such people are forced for the sake of their ideas to step over a corpse or wade through blood they can, I maintain, find within themselves, in their conscience, a justification, for wading through blood―which, you should note, depends on the idea and its dimensions. It's only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article (you remember it began with the legal question). There's no need for such anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right, they punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so quite justly fulfill their conservative vocation. But the same masses set these criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or less).  The first category is always the man of the present, the second the man of the future. The first preserve the world and people it, the second move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has an equal right to exist.'"
<br>Fyodor Dostoevsky<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"'One thing only is clear, that the appearance of all these grades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity some law of nature. That law, of course, is unknown at present, but I am convinced that it exists, and one day may become known. The vast mass of mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort, by some mysterious process, by some crossing of races and stocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a thousand with a spark of independence. One in ten thousand perhaps―I speak roughly, approximately―is born with some independence, and with still greater independence one in a hundred thousand. The man of genius is one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of humanity, appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions.'"
<br>Fyodor Dostoevsky<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"'Why the word 'ought'? It's not a matter of permission or prohibition. He will suffer if he is sorry for his victim. Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth.'"
<br>Fyodor Dostoevsky<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one."
<br>Wilhelm Stekel<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"As if that blind rage had washed me clean, rid me of hope; for the first time, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world."
<br>Albert Camus<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"'We always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception, something vast, vast! But why must it be vast? Instead of all that, what if it's one little room, like a bathhouse in the country, black and grimy and spiders in every corner, and that's all eternity is?'"
<br>Fyodor Dostoevsky<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"O my soul, do not aspire to immortal life, but exhaust the limits of the possible."
<br>Pindar<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"The vital longing for human immortality finds no consolation in reason and reason leaves us without incentive or consolation in life and life itself without real finality. But here, in the depths of the abyss, the despair of the heart and of the will and the scepticism of reason meet face to face and embrace like brothers. And we shall see from this embrace, a tragic―that is to say, an intimately loving―embrace, that the wellspring of life will flow, a life serious and terrible. Scepticism, uncertainty―the position to which reason, by practising its analysis upon itself, upon it own validity, at last arrives―is the foundation upon which the heart's despair must build up its hope."
<br>Miguel de Unamuno<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"O Lord, if there is a Lord, save my soul, if I have a soul."
<br>Ernest Renan<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"The known is finite, the unknown infinite; intellectually we stand on an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean of inexplicability. Our business in every generation is to reclaim a little more land."
<br>Thomas Henry Huxley<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"Whenever you feel an impulse to perpetrate a piece of exceptionally fine writing, obey it―whole-heartedly―and delete it before sending your manuscript to press. Murder your darlings."

<br>Stephen King<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"My love has sworn, with sealing kiss,
<br>With me to live―to die;
<br>I have at last my nameless bliss.
<br>As I love―loved am I!”
<br>Charlotte Brontë<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"Leinbach had discovered a proof that there really is no death. It is beyond question, he had declared, that not only at the moment of drowning, but at all the moments of death of any nature, one lives over again his past life with a rapidity inconceivable to others. This remembered life must also have a last moment, and this last moment its own last moment, and so on, and hence, dying is itself eternity, and hence, in accordance with the theory of limits, one may approach death but can never reach it."
<br>Arthur Schnitzler<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"The truth is that we live out our lives putting off all that can be put off; perhaps we all know deep down that we are immortal and that sooner or later all men will do and know all things."
<br>Jorge Luis Borges<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote"><br><br>"For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace."
<br>Romans 8:6<br><br><br></div>
<div class="quote">"A feeling, for which I have no name, has taken possession of my soul―a sensation which will admit of no analysis, to which the lessons of bygone time are inadequate, and for which I fear futurity itself will offer me no key."
